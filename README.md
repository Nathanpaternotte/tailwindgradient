## ⚡️ About The Project

I built this small tool because I needed a quick and visual way to generate gradient classes without the hassle. It's designed to be simple, fast, and compatible with the latest Tailwind CSS versions (v3/v4).

It currently supports **Linear** and **Radial** gradients, allowing you to copy the utility classes directly into your code.

## 🚀 Current Features (V1)

- **Linear Gradients:** Customize direction and colors.
- **Radial Gradients:** Create circular gradients easily.
- **Live Preview:** See the changes instantly as you tweak the settings.
- **Clean Output:** Generates standard Tailwind utility classes.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Here is what I'm planning for future updates:

- [ ] **UX Improvements:** Better sliders and clearer interface.
- [ ] **Conic Gradients:** Support for `bg-conic` utilities.
- [ ] **Gradient Percentages:** Fine-tune stop positions (e.g., `from-10%`, `via-30%`).
- [ ] **Custom Hex Colors:** Ability to input specific HEX codes beyond the default Tailwind palette.
- [ ] **Interpolation Mode:** Smoother color transitions.
