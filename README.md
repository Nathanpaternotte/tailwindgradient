## ⚡️ About The Project

I built this small tool because I needed a quick and visual way to generate gradient classes without the hassle. It's designed to be simple, fast, and compatible with the latest Tailwind CSS versions (v3/v4).

It currently supports **Linear** and **Radial** gradients, allowing you to copy the utility classes directly into your code.

## 🚀 Current Features (V1)

- **Linear Gradients:** Customize direction and colors.
- **Radial Gradients:** Create circular gradients easily.
- **Live Preview:** See the changes instantly as you tweak the settings.
- **Clean Output:** Generates standard Tailwind utility classes.
